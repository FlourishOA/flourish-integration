# flourish-integration
Web request generator for adding information to the FlourishOA database

### Installation 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage
We envisioned this tool as a helper for those trying to use the FlourishOA API (found [here](http://flourishoa.org/api/docs/)). It contains the tools we used to integrate the data we had scraped to our local machines into the site via the API. You will need a valid username/password pairing in order to be able to actually add data (or modify existing data) on our site. Please contact us through [the FlourishOA site](http://flourishOA.org) if you would like to add data or fix a possible mistake.
